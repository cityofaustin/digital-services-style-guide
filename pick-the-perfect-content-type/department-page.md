# Department Page

Department pages connect the services provided to residents to the department responsible for them. 

### Department name

There is no need to include “Austin” before the department name since it is clear this is a City of Austin website.

### Explain what your department does

This section gives residents an idea of the type of work you all do. Use service-oriented language and a conversational tone. Try to stay away from jargon and just listing out services.

### **Choose a relevant image**

Choose a high-resolution photo that gives context about the service. It should be people-oriented and warm, but avoid photos with identifiable faces unless you have a signed release.

Images must be a minimum of 1440px x 320px in size.

### **Share your mission**

This section shares your department’s mission with the public. Keep the vision for internal audiences because it often becomes white noise for residents.

### **Select a contact**

Contacts for a specific service should never be an individual, but instead include public-facing contact information such as a department name and public number, a public facility name and number, or 311.

### **Department director block, optional**

#### **Name**

Don’t include more than their name. There is a space for their title below.

#### Title

Write it as: Director, Name of Department.

#### **Director’s photo**

The image should be high-resolution and 144px x 144px in size. Choose a headshot with good lighting.

#### **About the director**

Give a brief overview of the Director’s previous experience and what they bring to the role. Keep the tone conversational and avoid listing out their resume.
