## Fee Tables

Charges for services offered by the City of Austin are referred to as fees, rather than prices or costs. Use a table to communicate fees even if there is only one service provided.

Decide how you will describe your service. For example, vaccines are administered per dose, and birth certificates are processed per copy. Include this language in the fee line next to the service provided.
