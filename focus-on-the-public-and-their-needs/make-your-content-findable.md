# Make your content findable

## Write with SEO in mind

### Research keywords

Start by thinking about words and phrases you would use to find this page. What problem is the searcher intending to solve? Try searching one of those phrases in Google, then scroll to the bottom of the first page and check the suggestions under “Searches related to \(your search term\).” Which of these most closely matches the searcher’s intent? Pick 2-3 keywords to incorporate into the title, description, the first 1-2 headers, and the first 1-2 steps or to "Related information" after the steps.

## Page descriptions <a id="page-descriptions"></a>

Page descriptions help search engines connect your content to users searching for it online. Users will use these descriptions to decide whether or not your page is what they are looking for, and if they want to visit it.

Page descriptions should describe clearly and concisely what a user will find if they visit the page you’re creating. Page descriptions are only visible in search engine results. They will not be visible on the page itself.

And, don’t worry about including your department’s name or the page title in the description. The page title will already be visible in the search engine results.

Page descriptions should be no longer than 245 characters or the description will be cut off. This includes letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.
