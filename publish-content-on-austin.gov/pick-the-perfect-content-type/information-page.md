# Information page

An Information Page provides supplementary information and resources for Service Pages to support service delivery.

## Research keywords

The best way to make sure your content is findable is to write using keywords. When drafting an information page in Joplin, you can navigate to the "Notes" tab at the top to find a text box for gathering keywords. This is just a simple tool that allows you to save keywords and allow other authors to reference them.  

Reference [the section of this style guide devoted to making content findable](https://app.gitbook.com/@cityofaustin/s/digital-style-guide/~/drafts/-MEY2fJmOy9M-2Ro-frs/focus-on-the-public-and-their-needs/make-your-content-findable) for best practice information.

## **Write a descriptive title**

Titles need to be clear and specific about what the resident will find on the page. A simple formula is: Noun + primary and secondary keywords. For example, Measles in Austin or Chronic disease prevention.

## **Write an effective page description**

Page descriptions help search engines connect your content to users searching for it online. Users will use these descriptions to decide whether or not your page is what they are looking for, and if they want to visit it.

Page descriptions should describe clearly and concisely what a user will find if they visit the page you’re creating. Page descriptions are only visible in search engine results. They will not be visible on the page itself.

### **How to write an effective description**

In 2-3 full sentences, describe what is actually on the page in understandable, accessible language as if you were speaking to a resident. Try to use words or phrases you think residents would use to search for this content.

And, don’t worry about including your department’s name or the page title in the description. The page title will already be visible in the search engine results.

Page descriptions should be no longer than 245 characters or the description will be cut off. This includes letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.

## **Add an application, optional**

If an application like a map or widget will help the resident access the service, include it on the page whenever possible.

However, if there are any clarifications that need to be made about how to effectively use the application, make sure they are included in the additional content.

## **Write additional content**

This section makes up the bulk of the Information Page, and supports long form content. Organize the information so that the most important information is at the top, and use H2 and H3 heading levels. In addition to making it easy for your users to find what they’re looking for, it also makes it easy for adaptable technology to make the most of your content. _\*\*_

## **Select a contact**

Contacts for a specific service should never be an individual, but instead include public-facing contact information such as a department name and public number, a public facility name and number, or 3-1-1.
