# Guide

The guide content type should be used to outline a complicated process, such as getting a permit or license. Guides consist of information and service pages, organized into sections. 

You might need a guide if you offer any service that requires people to take multiple, non-linear, or concurrent steps to get a process started or maintained. These steps may include

* Contacting more than one City department or office
* Filling out more than one form
* Submitting legal documents and fees

Just because information and service pages are related to each other does not mean they belong in the same guide. Include only the content necessary to complete a specific goal. Write and arrange the pages in a way that helps residents complete this goal. 

## Prepare your guide

### **Fact-check and get approval.**

Find out who the subject matter experts are and confirm their availability to review your content before publishing. It is important that you find a staff member who touches each part of the process. A manager may not be able to fully fact-check the process, and often a front-line staff member is needed. You also need to know who will approve the content before publishing. 

### Map out the service from end to end.

A fully researched and fact-checked service blueprint should include every task or event in the resident’s experience, as well as the front line staff processes. 

### **See if you can break it down into three or more phases of work.** 

For example, the [mobile food vendor permit guide](https://alpha.austin.gov/en/permits-tickets/business-permits-and-licenses/food-business-permits/mobile-food-vendor-permit-guide/) has these phases: 

1. Learn and prepare
2. Apply for a permit 
3. Get inspected
4. Renew or maintain your permit 

Next, break down the steps that must be taken during each phase. Each step can be drafted as a stand-alone information or service page. 

### **D**igitize forms.

You will want to gather any documentation that the resident must complete and submit in order to achieve their goal. Consider [digitizing the forms](https://app.gitbook.com/@cityofaustin/s/digital-style-guide/~/drafts/-MCm6R59SuCHivBy9u-u/publish-content-on-austin.gov/pick-the-perfect-content-type/form-container-page), if possible.

## **Create a guide in Joplin**

In order to create a guide, you must have some information and service pages ready to add. They can be published or in draft mode. 

### Research keywords. 

List out words and phrases you would use to find this guide. Good keywords for a guide heavily overlap with good keywords for the information and service pages in it. 

### Write a concise title. 

Titles need to be clear, concise, specific, and ideally incorporate a keyword. A good title conveys exactly what you can achieve with this guide. Examples: 

* Mobile food vendor permit guide
* Community garden permit guide

### **Write a concise page description.** 

Using 1-2 complete sentences and accessible language, describe what can be found on the page. Include keywords, and steer clear of acronyms, abbreviations, and jargon. For example, this is the description for the mobile food vendor permit guide: 

> Food trucks in Austin must have a permit by law. So does every other mobile food business, whether it’s in a bus, trailer, bike, pushcart or kiosk, or on foot. When you get a mobile food vendor permit, you help protect your customers from food-borne illnesses.

### **Add a topic and/or related department.**

You must select either one topic or one related department in order to publish. You may also select both or multiple. 

Think about your users when selecting topics. Ask yourself where residents are expecting to find this content. For example, a guide may have steps that require a resident both apply for a permit and learn rules about recycling. In this case, the guide might fall under the food business permits topic, as well as the recycling and reuse topic. 

Similarly, a guide process may touch multiple departments. For example, if the guide instructs users to submit paperwork to both Austin Public Health and Development Services, then you should select both as related departments. 

### Choose an image. 

If you are unsure about image best-practices, there is an [entire section](https://app.gitbook.com/@cityofaustin/s/digital-style-guide/put-your-best-photos-forward) in this guide to help.

### **Add a section header.** 

Your section header should clearly communicate the process phase. For example, the first section in the [mobile food vendor permitting guide](https://alpha.austin.gov/en/permits-tickets/business-permits-and-licenses/food-business-permits/mobile-food-vendor-permit-guide/) has the header “Learn and prepare” because this phase of the process is all about what a resident needs to know and do before trying to apply for their permit. 

### **Add pages to the section.**

Select the information and service pages that will make up the steps in the section. You can drag and drop to rearrange the order of steps as needed.

### **Add more sections.** 

Continue adding sections and pages until your guide is complete.

### Add a contact.

When choosing a contact for your guide, make sure that it is a public-facing phone line, email address, or both. 

Educating residents about complex services can be one of the hardest parts of administering them. People who help residents access a service on a regular basis are officially experts. If creating a guide inspires any ideas for explaining complex services to residents, please reach out to [odd@austintexas.gov](mailto:odd@austintexas.gov) and let us know. Thank you for your civic service!
