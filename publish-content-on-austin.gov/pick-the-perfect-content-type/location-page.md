# Location page

## When to use the location content type

The purpose of a location page is to provide details about a facility or space. You should create a location page for any space or facility that has a fixed address. Spaces without a fixed location, such as a mobile clinic, fall under the category of a service rather than a location.   
  
Location pages work with [service pages ](service-page.md)to help residents connect with services that are convenient to them. On a location page, you may link to any services that are administered there. You may also want to consider linking to the location page from the service page.

### **Title**

The title of your location page should be the same as the location’s name. Make sure residents will be able to find it if they search for it in Google Maps or any other GPS tool.

### **Location physical address**

Every location page should include a street address.

### Location physical address

Only use this if the mailing address is different from the physical address. 

### Alternate name

Include an alternate name if your location is co-located with another place, or if it is located inside of a larger facility. For example, WIC clinics are sometimes located inside neighborhood centers. 

### **C**ontact info

Only include a phone number if it is a direct line to the location. Don’t add 3-1-1 as the phone number for a location. Some locations don’t have phone numbers and that is okay. Phone description is not required, but can be useful if the phone number is a hotline or a line for making appointments, or any other purpose more specific than general information. 

### **Bus lines**

Include the three closest bus lines, within a 20 minute walking distance. 

### **Location hours**

Hours must be entered using military time. There is an option to include two sets of times for each day. This is useful if the location closes for lunch.

### **Hours exceptions**

Hours exceptions are any operating hours or closures that happen infrequently. For example, if a location stays open late on the first Friday of each month, the hours exceptions text box is the right space to communicate that. This is also where you may indicate City holiday closures.

### Related services

In this section, you can add any services that are administered at the location. When you do so, you must either enter specific hours of operation for the service or choose to default to the location’s hours. Similar to the hours section for the location, you can also indicate any hours exceptions. Hours exceptions include holiday hours or uncommon hours.  Additionally, the service hours exceptions text box is the appropriate place to communicate if a service requires an appointment. 

Once you have selected the related services to be featured on the location page, make sure to go to that service page and associate a location. Service pages allow you to include a step with location, and you may also use a hyperlink if the location needs to be featured in an option.
