Photographs are a visual representation of the City and of Austin. As such, they should be professional, beautiful, compelling and representative of the diversity and unique character Austin offers.  All photos should:
     
## Give Context
Photos should be related to the associated information and give the resident context. For example, use an image of a resident placing their Christmas tree on a curb for the “Recycle your Christmas Tree” service page. 

Avoid adding photos just for the sake of having photos. Only add a photo when it provides context and helps the reader with comprehension. Otherwise, the photo only serves as clutter. 

## Be Genuine and People-Oriented

* Photos should evoke warmth, be inclusive, and be diverse. 

* Photos should be real and genuine. Do not use stock photos, models or over-posed/staged photos. 

* Photos should show action and have a human presence.

* Photos should be a detail or up-close shot of the subject or up to a distance of 15' maximum to streamline scale.

## Be High Quality
* Photos should be crisp and high quality. 

* Avoid blurring or using filters.

* Do not use photos that are stretched or shrunk.

## Available for Use

* While photos should be people-oriented, avoid photos with identifiable faces, unless a photo release has been obtained by the person captured. Otherwise, if taking pictures of the public, try to capture photos of hands, backs of heads, etc. 

* Avoid photographing logos and other copyrighted materials

* Do not use photos you have not taken yourself without explicit permission. photos can’t be taken from Google or any other website without the photographer’s permission, as this is copyright infringement. 

* Also, many photographers require attribution listed wherever the photo is located. Attribution would be: “Image source: Jack Austin Photography” Here’s an example:
